1.1. IS COMPUTER SCIENCE SCIENCE AND COMPUTING IS A NATURAL SCIENCE

a) According to Denning, what is the field of "computer science" really about?

-It is the science of information processes and their interactions with the world.

b) What does it mean that computer science is a natural science?

-The old definition of computer science — the study of phenomena surrounding computers— is now obsolete. Computing is the study ofnatural and artificial 
 information processes.

c) Which fundamental categories cover the field of computing?

-Computation, Communication, Interaction, Recollection, Automation, Design.


1.2. HACKERS AND PAINTERS

a) Which different types of people does Graham separate computer scientists into?

-Mathematicians, Historians of Computers and Hackers

b) What is the meaning of the "sketching" within programming?

-It means that a programming language should, above all, be malleable. A programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs
 you’ve already thought of.

c) What can programmers learn from painters concerning collaboration?

-The right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them 
 that are as carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming languages.


1.3. SOFTWARE ENGINEERING NOT COMPUTER SCIENCE

a) Who are scientists and engineers, respectively, accountable to?

-Scientists learn what is true, how to test hypotheses,and how to extend knowledge in their field. Engineers learn what is true, what is useful,
 and how to apply well-understood knowledge to solve practical problems.

b) Who or what is to blame for the lack of professional development within the software industry?

-The software job market has been growing faster than the educational infrastructure needed to support it, and so more than half the people
 holding software development jobs have been educated in subjects other than software.

c) ) What is the definition of engineering?

-Engineering is the application of scientific principles toward practical ends.


2.1. THE BLACK ART OF PROGRAMMING

a) Why were the first programmers women?

-Because it was thought that the programming side was more suited to women than men.

b) In which decade was it realized that programming is not just routine work?

- In the 60s.

c) Which book (and concept) resulted from the failure of the IBM operating system OS/360?

- The Mythical Man-Month.


2.2. THE SHAPING OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

a) Which technology made the development of the personal computer possible?

- Microprocessors

b) What is the idea behind "computer liberation"?

-Making computing accessible to ordinary people.

c) Which role did IBM play in the advancement of the personal computer?

-Using second generation microprocessors which were fastest on the market at that time.


2.3. ENCRYPTION RESEARCH REVIEW

a) What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric key encryption?

- A symmetric key, sometimes called private-key, encryption cipher is any algorithm in which the key for encryption is trivially related to the key used for decryption.
  A asymetric key would compare to a lock that has one key for engaging the lock and a different key for disengaging the lock

b) What does the strength of the RSA encryption system rely on?

- RSA encryption, named for the surnames of the inventors, relies on multiplication and exponentiation being much faster than prime factorization. 

c) Why are quantum computers considered a threat to modern encryption systems?

- Numbers that would typically takes billions of years to compute could only take a matter of hours or even minutes with a fully developed quantum computer.


3.1. MACHINE LEARNING

a) What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

- In supervised learning approach, the goal is to learn a mapping from inputs x to outputs y, given a labeled set of input-output pairs D.
  We now consider unsupervised learning, where we are just given output data, without any inputs. 

b) Do people mostly learn by supervised or unsupervised learning? Explain your reasoning.

- They use both types of learning.

c) Explain the K-nearest neighbors classifier.

- Illustration of a K-nearest neighbors classifier in 2d for K = 3. The 3 nearest neighbors of test point x1 have labels 1, 1 and 0, 
 so we predict p(y = 1|x1, D, K = 3) = 2/3. The 3 nearest neighbors of test point x2 have labels 0, 0, and 0, so we predict p(y = 1|x2, D, K = 3) = 0/3.

d) ) What is the meaning of overfitting?

- When we fit highly flexible models, we need to be careful that we do not overfit the data, that is, we should avoid trying to model
  every minor variation in the input, since this is more likely to be noise than true signal.

e) What does the no free lunch theorem say?

- As a consequence of the no free lunch theorem, we need to develop many different types of models, to cover the wide variety of data that occurs in the real world.


3.2. THE (R)EVOLUTION OF VIRTUAL REALITY

a) What definition of virtual reality (VR) do you prefer?

- Virtual Reality is an alternate world filled with computer­generated images that respond to human movements.

b) What is the difference between VR and VW (virtual world)? Give examples.

- VW =  A synchronous, persistent network of people, represented as avatars, facilitated by networked computers

c) Give an example of an early use of VR.

- One of the first of these technologies was the Sensorama (Sherman, 2002); an immersive multimodal experience made possible through a mechanical machine.

d) Why are traditional HUDs (head-up displays) discouraged in the case of VR, and what is proposed as an alternative?

-HUDs destroy the immertion in the virtual world. Alternatives are better tools developed to create a similar feeling to the real world.

e) What is meant by "suspension of disbelief", and what is it replaced by in the case of VR?

- The active suspension of belief is required in order to remember that the virtual world is not real, since our entire perceptual system is telling us that it is.


3.3. A SURVEY OF AUGMENTED REALITY

a) What is the definition of augmented reality (AR)?

- Augmented Reality (AR) is a variation of Virtual Environments (VE), or Virtual Reality as it is more commonly called. 

b) Give an example of a possible use of AR in the medical field.

-  Virtual fetus inside womb of pregnant patient. 

c) ) Give an example of a military use of AR.

- Military aircraft and helicopters have used Head-Up Displays (HUDs) and Helmet-Mounted Sights (HMS) to superimpose vector graphics upon the
  pilot's view of the real world. 

d) Explain the difference between optical and video AR technologies.

- Optical HDMs = placing optical combiners in front of the user's eyes
  Video HDMs = with one or two mounted video cameras

e) Do you think optical or video technologies will dominate in the long run? Explain your reasoning. 

- The Video technology has more potential, but both can have uses.


5.1. COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE

a) Describe the "imitation game" proposed by Turing. What is the purpose of the test?

A man, a woman and an interrogator who has to guess which one is woman and man with questions

b) What is meant by the term universal machine?

- A discrete state machine that has multiple choices and thought.

c) What is the difference between a discrete state machine and a continuous machine?

- A discrete system is a system with a countable number of states. Continous machines have an infinite number of states.

d) Do you believe that Turing's test is adequate to determine if a computer is able to think?

- I think it depends on more factors than just a test. It has to evolve continously


5.2 MINDS, BRAINS, AND PROGRAMS 

a) Give a description of the thought experiment "the Chinese Room". What is Searle trying to demonstrate with this idea?

- The aim of the Chinese room example was to try to show this by showing that as soon as we put something into the system that really does 
 have intentionality (a man), and we program him with the formal program, you can see that the formal program carries no additional intentionality.

b) Searle refers to a program which is claimed to be able to explain human understanding. Why doesn't Searle believe this to be the case?

- Because the human brain has a chemistry side that the machines can't reach at the moment.

c) Does Searle believe that it is possible to build a thinking machine out of any material? Why / why not?

- It is possible because the mechanisms make the thinking possible for the machine.

d) Give an example of a counterargument to the Chinese Room thought experiment as well as Searle's response.

- It adds nothing, for example, to a man's ability to understand Chinese.


5.3 QUANTUM COMPUTATION

a) What is a qubit? Give an example of what could act as a qubit in a quantum computer.

- A qubit is a two-state quantum-mechanical system, such as the polarization of a single photon: here the two states are vertical 
  polarization and horizontal polarization.

b) A 3-bit register in a regular computer can store one number in the range 0-8. How many numbers can be stored in a 3-qubit register in a quantum computer?

- 2^n = 2^3 = 8

c) Quantum computers are better suited for so-called algorithmic searches than for searching through a database. What is the difference between 
   these two applications, and what is the problem with using a quantum computer for searching through a database?

-  This is because the operation of transferring a database from classical to quantum memory — from bits to qubits — would itself require about O(N) steps.

d) Why do quantum computers pose a threat to modern cryptosystems? And why is it important to consider this problem already now?

- Numbers that would typically takes billions of years to compute could only take a matter of hours or even minutes with a fully developed quantum computer.
